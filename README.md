# 🎵 SONG-THE-SIZR : Song Synthesizer for Dialogue Analysis 📑 and Drama Story 🎭

## Main Feature
- This is a program for converting lyrics into Dialogue Analysis or Drama Story (User can choose)
- Dialogue Analysis : Dataframe of Dialogue with `Scene Number` , `Character` , `Dialogue` , `Emotion` and `Action`
- Drama Script : Abbreviated Story of lyrics
- Generated prompt by AI (But with main structure , I written by myself)
  
## Behind Story of this project
It originates from my passion in Drama Arts and Technologies. So , I come up with an idea to create some innovations to make user feel more convenient and save more time instead of thinking and doing all process by themselves. The name of this project comes from "Synthesizer" . Meaning for how our program can synthesize raw materials into something special.
